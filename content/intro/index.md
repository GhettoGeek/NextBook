**NextBook** is quick and easy way to buid technical books or documentation that support modern standards and run blazingly fast. It works by compiling markdown or MDX to static pages. This way, first content render on user's device is near instant.

NextBook makes writing technical docs stupid simple while keeping featureset minimal.

## Getting Started

1. Bootstrap a project with `npx create-next-app my-awesome-book -e https://github.com/amiroff/NextBook/tree/master/template`
2. Run `npm run dev` and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
3. Check examples to see what's possible with NextBook.
4. Create your [markdown](/documentation/markdown) or [MDX](/documentation/using-mdx) content in `pages` folder.
5. Update `config/config.json` with your table of contents and other information.
6. Build (`npm run build`) and [deploy](https://vercel.com/new) your repository to any static hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, Github Pages or Google Cloud.
7. Profit! 🎉

This should be enough to have a statically generated documentation page / book.

With the advantages of [Next.js](https://nextjs.com), anything fancy (grading, level switching, you name it..) can be added along the way.

!> Use Right Tool For The Job 
NextBook is not geared towards API documentation, rather it is optimised for tutorial/book style documentation. For API docs [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or plain [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) would be a better fit.
